GCD and LCM Calculator
This is a basic calculator for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two integers. It is written in C++ and uses the Euclidean algorithm for calculating the GCD.

Usage
To use the calculator, simply run the program and follow the prompts. The program will ask you to enter 1 to calculate the GCD, 2 to calculate the LCM, or 0 to exit the program. Once you have made a selection, the program will prompt you to enter the two integers for which you would like to find the GCD or LCM. The calculator will then output the result.

Installation
To run this program, you will need a C++ compiler, such as GCC or Visual Studio. You can also use an IDE such as Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code.

The code also include a header file "windows.h" which is a Microsoft-specific header file, so this code is only compatible with Windows.

Error Handling
The code includes try-catch block for handling the overflow/underflow error. It will display an error message if the input value exceeds the range of long long int.

Support
If you have any issues or questions about the calculator, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact the developer directly.
